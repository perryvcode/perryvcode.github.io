    <h3 id="cosmopolis"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolis_(novel)">Cosmopolis by Don DeLillo</a></h3>
    <img class="imgfloat" src="images/delillo-cosmopolis.jpg" alt="cover of cosmopolis by don delillo" />
    <p>This is my second book by DeLillo--the first being White Noise. Their stories are not very comparable outside of the main characters being under the threat of something. In Cosmopolis, we follow the uber-affluent Eric Packer as he decides one day to get a haircut. Usually, he would hire someone come to him, but today he wants the damp, smelly New York City air to caress his body and soul as he takes a drive to a barber.</p>
    <p>His journey involves mostly being stuck in traffic, but even traffic is still much different to the wealthy. He is able to call up various coworkers and specialists to his car, to guide him, to shoot the shit with him and, for one lucky call-up, check his prostate. When he is not conducting these silly appointments, he is either jumping out of the car to impulsively eat or question his new wife who seems just as aloof as he is albeit with her own flair. All the while, he expouses his feelings and philosophies about the world around him, and what it means to him. Most of his ramblings do not make sense, or feel a bit hollow coming from such a spoiled brat, but they are intersting--they make you think. I could not tell you a lick of what he said, but the way he presents it is not boring to the reader and could elicit some cynicism about our fellow man if read into deep enough.</p>
    <p>Overall, the book isn't something I would recommend, but it was short and interesting enough for me to wonder about it to this day.</p>

    <h3 id="kotfm"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(book)">Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann</a></h3>
    <img class="imgfloat" src="images/killers-of-the-flower-moon.jpg" alt="cover of killers of the flower moon by david grann" />
    <p>I wanted to read this before I saw the movie, and after seeing the movie I wanted to read it even more. I finally got around to it and was equal parts capitvated and harrowed by the story.</p>
    <p>The book does a fantastic job giving history on the Osage people and land before diving into the nefarious forces looking to strip the Osage of their land (and their wealth from the oil on said land). Even though I had seen the movie, I could not believe the lengths the white people in the area went to to earn the rights to the Osage land. Clever accounting to keep some of the spoils is only the tip of the iceberg. As the book details, there were years-long plots against some of the Osage to gain the rights to their money involving love, deception and straight up murder. </p>
    <p>In the second half, the book details the regional and federal investigations into the allegations made by the Osage population. Most of the time, these allegations fell flat, but how and why? It takes the FBI (and a very special agent, Tom White) to eventually uncover the truly evil plots carried out by people like William Hale, Ernest Burkhart and their cronies--and they're just the ones who got caught.</p>
    <p>The book makes you wonder: how could someone do this to another human being? It really tests your faith in humanity. In the wrong mindset, it could be extremely depressing and make you feel helpless. In other mindsets: compassion. Compassion that you, as the reader and learner of these facts, would never ever be embroiled in something like this and compassion that you would stand up against it should you notice anything similar.</p>

    <h3 id="valis"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valis_(novel)">VALIS by Philip K. Dick</a></h3>
    <img class="imgfloat" src="images/pkd-valis.jpg" alt ="cover of VALIS by Philip K Dick" />
    <p>I was struggling to remember much about this book as I started this review. After briefly reaquainting myself with the story on Wikipedia, I started to remember the twists and turns this story took me. A man named Horselover Fat experiences visions through a pink light that gives him semi-clairvoyant powers and tons of paranoid schizophrenia. In fact, I think the only clairvoyance he receives is about an illness his son has, which does ultimately save his son's livelihood. The visions are too realistic not to investigate, so he and some friends work to find the source of the pink light. The group thinks it must come from somewhere in space, and their searching gets an unexpected boost from a visit to the cinema. Horselover Fat and his friends see a movie named Valis that describes the feelings Horselover felt at the beginning of the novel. They eventually meet the movie makers who introduce them to a small child named Sophia. This child, Horselover finds, is the one who communicated with him through the pink light. This child can communicate with Horselover in the current moment as well, and eventually leads him and his buddies out of the influence of the movie makers. Sophia's final message to Horselover Fat is to find faith in humans, not an ethereal pink light or a god.</p>
    <p>I felt it to be very meta and self-referential for Philip K Dick, who already loves that sort of thing. The split personalities of Horselover Fat and Philip K Dick himself, and interspersal of journal entries called an "Exegesis" intrigued me, but moreso confused me. At the end of the novel, Philip K. Dick resumes control of his personality split and calls the whole thing a schizophrenic episode, due to a drug he is consuming (and some other traumatic shit). I would not recommend this to others unless they were a PKD sicko.</p>

<h3 id="purity">The Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing by Soren Kierkegaard</h3>
<img class="imgfloat" src="images/kierkegaard-purity-of-heart.jpg" alt="cover of The Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing by Soren Kierkegaard" />
<p>A reread of the man who, along with Albert Camus, exploded my interest in existential philosophy. It is hard to briefly summarize such a dense text, but Kierkegaard does make his philosophy in Purity of Heart quite digestible for the average reader. By setting his discussion in the "Office of the Confessional"--the spritiual discussion so often depicted as a wooden chamber where an individual discusses their inner turmoil with a priest on the other side of a mesh divider--he is able to give readers the simple context they need to not only understand his philosophy better, he also provides them with an easy launchpad to contextualize their turmoil alongside his philosophy.</p>
<p>If I had to summarize what the Danish pimp discusses throughout this book, it is to live life with the sole devotion of living it. This means not shying away from punishment, not doing certain tasks solely for the reward, not allowing the busy-ness of life keep you from living life to the fullest--all sorts of things that either hinder us from living our life with complete faithful devotion or seem like part of devotion but truly are not. It's about having faith in yourself; that you can make the most of the journey--bumps and all--by believing that how you are living is the best you can do and always striving to make that "best" even better.</p>
<blockquote><p>All has its time, there is 'a time to be born and a time to die'; there is a time to jest lightheartedly in the spring breeze, and a time to break under the autumn storm; there is a time to burst forth into blossom, beside the running water, beloved by the stream, and a time to wither and be forgotten; a time to be sought out for one's beauty and a time to be unnoticed in one's wretchedness; there is a time to be nursed with care, and a time to be cast out with contempt; there is a time to delight in the warmth of the morning sun and a time to perish in the night's cold.</p><footer>--Soren Kierkegaard, The Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing</footer></blockquote>

<h3 id="portnoy"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portnoy%27s_Complaint">Portnoy's Complaint by Philip Roth</a></h3>
<img class="imgfloat" src="images/roth-portnoys-complaint.jpg" alt="cover of Portnoy's Complaint by Philip Roth" />
<p>At times this was too frank and brash, but over time, I learned to love how the explicit nature of the protagonist, Alexander Portnoy. A man with insatiable perversions, he regales his therapist, Dr. Spielvogel, with details and family-based historical context about his perversions and the places and people it leads him.</p>
<p>The more I learn about the background of this book--how Philip Roth was inspired by his ex wife dying and not having to worry about her getting fifty percent of the book's sales; how the book was banned in Australia and copies of it were hidden in nondescript vans across New South Wales; how polarizing it was across the United States, particularly within the Jewish community--the more I like it. At the very least it is hard not to respect a story that caused such an uproar among many cultures. This book will make anyone blush. I wonder how many people put it down for good after the infamous liver scene. Hopefully many more kept trucking because the scenes in Israel near the end are some of the most interesting and freaky in the book.</p>
<blockquote><p>Portnoy's Complaint: A disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic impulses perpetually are warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature ...</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="covering islam"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_Islam">Covering Islam by Edward W. Said</a></h3>
<img class="imgfloat" src="images/said-covering-islam.jpg" alt="cover of Covering Islam by Edward W. Said" />
<p>It is difficult to summarize a book so rich and dense with theories and analyses as this, or any of Said's works, but a great deal of it falls under the broad umbrella of Islam being too rich and complex for any one person, news agency or government agency to cover generally. Like his work in <em>Orientalism</em>, Said explains that for one, particularly one who is not a Muslim or has grown up among the teachings of Islam, to even remotely grasp the centuries-long tapestry of this religion and culture, they must study everything about it for decades. One must full immerse oneself in the people, the writings, the history, the lands of what they are studying. Unlike natural sciences, Said claims, the studying of people and cultures are open to interpretation. Interpretation that can have a lot of bias and influence by stronger forces, like imperialist governments, specail interest groups and the like.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Said uses the classic claim of "knowledge is power" to showcase how powerful entities, particularly Western powers and their arms, gain this knowledge and use its power against those within its grasp and to gain further grasps around the rest of the world. Because Western powers have colonialized so much of the "Eastern" world, or at least have the resources to mine these places for their resources and knowledge of their lands, they are able to package this knowledge, shape it and spin it out however they please to their constituents. Their consituents either adopt this packaged point of view or do not fight it because they do not know any better, or are simply powerless. These packages of information are harmful in several ways. In the case of Islam, the screening of information leads to restrictive views of Islam, less pushback against invasions into Muslim-majority countries, and, quite frankly, wrong and terrible opinions. Said says that knowledge should be sought out of geniune personal interest, to share life with other people. The acquisition of knowledge for the aims of dominating peoples near and abroad is a gross and damaging display of the human pysche and can be argued as anti-thetical to the acquisition in the first place.</p>
<p>Said continues to open my eyes to the powers around me, particularly how those in power will change their opinions at the drop of a hat if it suits their needs of power and money. While his writing is often dense and challenging, it is equally enriching.</p>

<img class="imgfloat" src="images/21-russian-short-prose-from-an-odd-century.jpg" alt="cover of 21 russian short prose from an odd century" />
<p>I have read plenty of Russian works from their Golden Era, but have read very few from contemporary authors. Thanks to my friend Eleanor, I read some really cool, modern shit and learned of some new authors to look further into.</p>
<p>My favorite stories in the collection are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smirnov by Vladimir Sorokin</li>
  <li>Verkhovsky and Son by Leonid Kostyukov</li>
  <li>The Victim by Elena Dolgopyat (This one reminded me of The Overcoat by Gogol)</li>
  <li>Tongue by Pavel Peppershtein</li>
  <li>Alkonost by Valery Votrin</li>

<h3 id="no logo"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Logo">No Logo by Naomi Klein</a></h3>
<img class="imgfloat" src="images/klein-no-logo.jpg" alt="cover of no logo by naomi klein" />
<p>Naomi Klein floors with me with every piece. The way she is able to carefully study and unpack the endeavors she tackles is inspirational. It is obvious from her first book, No Logo, that she is a special talent. This is not an examination of one part of the explosion of brands--this is an examination of everything. Klein is able to provide historical and societal context for the rise in power of "brand bullies" like Nike, Adidas, BP, Shell, guiding readers on a tour of the movements these brands made to become as powerful as they are and the response from the public to these movements.</p>
<p>As we continue reading, Klein provides a thoughtful background on how companies moved from manufacturing products to building a brand. As Klein shows us, a lot of these major corporations do not actually manufacture anything themselves. They hire shoddy contractors in poor nations, getting away with paying pennies to people who have nowhere else to work. These factory workers, again for pennies, then quickly manufacture the products for Levi's, Reebok, Banana Republic and sell them to the western world as a lifestyle (only for hundreds of dollars a piece!) Fucked up, right?</p>
<p>Klein agrees. While she does not always tout her personal feelings on the matter (she is also not shy about saying them either), she makes clear that this is wrong, that something should be done about this. This catapults the book into a look and discussion on the social movements that oppose the overreach of these brands and the destruction they cause. This is where things get extra cool to me. I learned about brand disrupters and ad busters, social causes that bravely oppose something that is very easy to give into. Something Klein asks readers to keep in mind is how easily some of these social movements are co-opted by the brand bullies and used as further branding. Keep an eye out for bullshit, reduce your purchases from your local mega-malls.</p>

<h3 id="roadside picnic"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadside_Picnic">Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky</a></h3>
<img class="imgfloat" src="images/roadside-picnic.jpg" alt="cover of roadside picnic" />
<p>After searching for the Strugatsky brothers everywhere I went, I finally found them at a BMV location in downtown Toronto. After reading this one, I am kicking myself for not buying more. These dudes can write their asses off!</p>
<p>The book does not detail when the story takes place, but readers are immediately thrust into a world that has recently been "visited" by some sort of extraterrestrial group. This is evidenced to inhabitants of this world by the "impact" the visit left. Whoever these beings are or were, they left some of their tools and technology. Not only that, their visit changed the environment and makeup of the land, creating "zones" that brave adventurers of the state called "stalkers" traverse and collect items from.</p>
<p>From the first description of the main "zone", the Strugatsky brothers are able to create a palpable atmosphere in the minds of readers. One can feel the dread of the zone, the peril of any slight misstep. Following a disillusioned man named Redrick, readers are taken on several journeys through the zone. The one thing readers do not get, however, is much insight on the visitors themselves. In fact, Redrick and seemingly every other human does not have any insight either. This is a major talking point throughout the story, and a basis for a lot of the philosophical discussion that takes place in the book. This discussion culminates with a poignant analogy by Dr. Valentine Pilman (below), likening current humans to nervous animals watching a rowdy picnic take place within their forest habitats.</p>
<blockquote><p>A picnic. Picture a forest, a country road, a meadow. Cars drive off the country road into the meadow, a group of young people get out carrying bottles, baskets of food, transistor radios, and cameras. They light fires, pitch tents, turn on the music. In the morning they leave. The animals, birds, and insects that watched in horror through the long night creep out from their hiding places. And what do they see? Old spark plugs and old filters strewn around... Rags, burnt-out bulbs, and a monkey wrench left behind... And of course, the usual mess—apple cores, candy wrappers, charred remains of the campfire, cans, bottles, somebody’s handkerchief, somebody’s penknife, torn newspapers, coins, faded flowers picked in another meadow.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="hotel du lac"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_du_Lac">Hotel Du Lac by Anita Brookner</a></h3>
<img class="imgfloat" src="images/brookner-hotel-du-lac.jpg" alt="cover of hotel du lac by Anita Brookner" />
<p>A fun, easy read from a free Little Library in my neighborhood. What a find!<p>
<p>Hotel Du Lac is about a writer named Edith Hope on a sort of sabbatical between books, setting up shop in an out-of-season hotel in Switzerland. Although a fresh perspective on her next book is not the only reason she's there, as readers find out throughout the story. After leaving her fiance at the altar and engaging in an affair with a married man, her friends tell her she just has to get outta town--reset.</p>
<p>The sleepy Hotel Du Lac provides little in entertainment and distraction from her troubles until the very end of her stay. After becoming acquainted with a wealthy, single, smooth operator named Phillip Neville (not the soccer player), he asks her to marry her. But it is not a proposal out of undying love, but rather... convenience? I am not sure if that is the write word but it is a form of settling, as described in the book--as if Neville and Hope should just check this box off and do all the other things life has for them. At first, this does not sound terrible to Edith. She's love sick over her married lover and could really use the stability to help her focus on her work. Despite her past marital troubles however, Edith cannot accept such a convenience. Love, marriage, whatever it is must come through the spontaneity of life. It cannot be typed up on a document and signed, it must be lived. It must hurt, and it must kick ass.</p>

<p>Duuuude I looooooooved watching this.</p>
<p>Marketed on the criterion channel as a "female office space", this movie is that and then some. It describes the mundane and ordinary aspects of an office job so well, and describes what it is like to feel that type of boredom while also being under the constant threat of termination as a temporary worker. It gives the "does any of this even matter?" feeling that office space does so well while also being much more stylish in the way it tells it. the first half, particularly, is full of quirky elevator-like music and cool frames that give the movie a touch of the surreal while also being so damn real.
<p>This movie is so wonderful. It is deeply human. I feel like I lived this movie.</p>
<p>The friendship arc of the friend group plays out exactly how things do in real life. I can't even remember the names of some of the people I worked with as a temp, even though, at times, we were decently close.</p>
<p>It was fun to hear Toni Collette's aussie accent come out here n there too.</p>

<p>The plot is a bit messy, but this is one of the most stylish movies I have ever seen. The music is sooooo sick. Thievery corporation, massive attack type vibes. Vibrant set design too—a nice mix of art deco LA and dense, futuristic could-be-anywhere international cityscapes.</p>
<p>I am “Liking” this so I know to revisit it and the original, unique styling of it all, but I am still not sure where I stand on the story. What I do know is that Willem Defoe is becoming one of my favorite actors. He is the man</p>

<p>Tornado warning near the end of the film kinda took me out of things, but this is a sleek and unique movie about sex and grief. It did not land for me, but I bet if I saw this in the 90s I would have been blown out of my mind. Very stylish and has some cool philosophy mixed in, but, again, did not fully click for me. I would like to revisit this one soon.</p>

<h3><a href="https://boxd.it/5BZFtD">Cosmopolis (2012)</a></h3>
<img src="images/cosmopolis.jpg" alt="cover poster for cosmopolis" />
<p>R Pat is amazing, but the movie is as weird as the book. Cronenberg did good to adapt it but it is not a very entertaining story.</p>
<p>Jay Baruchel felt outta place, but I love him so it is fine. Juliette Binoche is super hot. I did <strong>not</strong> see Paul Giamatti coming in—wow. </p>
<p>Overall, I am very impressed with Cronenberg's adaptation of such a strange story. Even if the source isn’t my favorite novel, it fits in with a pattern in Cronenberg’s work. Throughout a lot of Cronenberg’s movies, we see characters interacting in different realities and consciousnesses. Eric packer of cosmopolis does not think like normal people. He sees numbers, dollar signs and high frequency theoretical nonsense spinning about him—not someone simply crossing the street. He lives in a world unlike the common person. Makes sense Cronenberg wanted to give this one a go, even if it did not click for me.</p>

<img src="images/once-upon-a-time-in-america.jpg" alt="cover poster for once upon a time in america by sergio leone" />
<p>A gorgeous technical achievement, sergio leone makes a movie that feels like reading a Bildungsroman. You breathe in these characters and grow with them. Bobby D and James Woods put in incredible performances. Noodles is too violent and greedy for me to empathize with for most of the movie, but Bobby D brought me back 'round in the final act.</p>
<p>I read a great review from Critic Carlo Affatigato that talks about how Noodles spent a lot of the film wondering what happened and what's going to happen. When he finally gets some closure in the final act, he cannot accept it nor does he pursue it further. He just lets it wash over him like he does with everything else in the movie/his life.</p>
<p>James Woods is too damn good in this, for real.</p>

<p>Sucked hella ass to be honest. Some of the filmmaking techniques were very neat, and the long shots of the American landscape reminded me of reading Kerouac's On The Road, but it just was not an entertaining movie at all. The counterculture shit probably hit harder back then but it is pretty lame to me today.</p>
