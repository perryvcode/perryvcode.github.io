    <h3 id="cosmopolis"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolis_(novel)">Cosmopolis by Don DeLillo</a></h3>
    <img src="images/delillo-cosmopolis.jpg" alt="cover of cosmopolis by don delillo" />
    <ul><li>Main character: Eric Packer</li>
    <li>Setting: futuristic New York City</li>
    <li>Brief synopsis: rich venture capitalist Eric Packer takes a drive through New York City for a haircut and discusses his thoughts on life along the way</li></ul>
    <p>This is my second book by DeLillo--the first being White Noise. Their stories are not very comparable outside of the main characters being under the threat of something. In Cosmopolis, we follow the uber-affluent Eric Packer as he decides one day to get a haircut. Usually, he would hire someone come to him, but today he wants the damp, smelly New York City air to caress his body and soul as he takes a drive to a barber.</p>
    <p>His journey involves mostly being stuck in traffic, but even traffic is still much different to the wealthy. He is able to call up various coworkers and specialists to his car, to guide him, to shoot the shit with him and, for one lucky call-up, check his prostate. When he is not conducting these silly appointments, he is either jumping out of the car to impulsively eat or question his new wife who seems just as aloof as he is albeit with her own flair. All the while, he expouses his feelings and philosophies about the world around him, and what it means to him. Most of his ramblings do not make sense, or feel a bit hollow coming from such a spoiled brat, but they are intersting--they make you think. I could not tell you a lick of what he said, but the way he presents it is not boring to the reader and could elicit some cynicism about our fellow man if read into deep enough.</p>
    <p>Overall, the book isn't something I would recommend, but it was short and interesting enough for me to wonder about it to this day.</p>

    <h3 id="kotfm"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(book)">Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann</a></h3>
    <img src="images/killers-of-the-flower-moon.jpg" alt="cover of killers of the flower moon by david grann" />
    <ul><li>Main players: Ernest Burkhart, William Hale, Mollie Burkhart (and the Osage community, by extenstion), Federal agent Tom White</li>
    <li>Setting: Osage County, Oklahoma</li>
    <li>Brief synopsis: increasing numbers of Osage Indians are being murdered under suspicious conditions--how and why? Eventually, the FBI sends in Tom White to check it out.</li></ul>
    <p>I wanted to read this before I saw the movie, and after seeing the movie I wanted to read it even more. I finally got around to it and was equal parts capitvated and harrowed by the story.</p>
    <p>The book does a fantastic job giving history on the Osage people and land before diving into the nefarious forces looking to strip the Osage of their land (and their wealth from the oil on said land). Even though I had seen the movie, I could not believe the lengths the white people in the area went to to earn the rights to the Osage land. Clever accounting to keep some of the spoils is only the tip of the iceberg. As the book details, there were years-long plots against some of the Osage to gain the rights to their money involving love, deception and straight up murder.</p>
    <p>In the second half, the book details the regional and federal investigations into the allegations made by the Osage population. Most of the time, these allegations fell flat, but how and why? It takes the FBI (and a very special agent, Tom White) to eventually uncover the truly evil plots carried out by people like William Hale, Ernest Burkhart and their cronies--and they're just the ones who got caught.</p>
    <p>The book makes you wonder: how could someone do this to another human being? It really tests your faith in humanity. In the wrong mindset, it could be extremely depressing and make you feel helpless. In other mindsets: compassion. Compassion that you, as the reader and learner of these facts, would never ever be embroiled in something like this and compassion that you would stand up against it should you notice anything similar.</p>

    <h3 id="valis"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valis_(novel)">VALIS by Philip K. Dick</a></h3>
    <img src="images/pkd-valis.jpg" alt ="cover of VALIS by Philip K Dick" />
    <ul><li>Main character: Horselover Fat</li>
        <li>Setting: California</li>
        <li>Brief synopsis: Horselover Fat, alter ego of Philip K Dick, is randomly "struck" by a pink light that scrambles his brain.</li></ul>
    <p>I was struggling to remember much about this book as I started this review. After briefly reaquainting myself with the story on Wikipedia, I started to remember the twists and turns this story took me. A man named Horselover Fat experiences visions through a pink light that gives him semi-clairvoyant powers and tons of paranoid schizophrenia. In fact, I think the only clairvoyance he receives is about an illness his son has, which does ultimately save his son's livelihood. The visions are too realistic not to investigate, so he and some friends work to find the source of the pink light. The group thinks it must come from somewhere in space, and their searching gets an unexpected boost from a visit to the cinema. Horselover Fat and his friends see a movie named Valis that describes the feelings Horselover felt at the beginning of the novel. They eventually meet the movie makers who introduce them to a small child named Sophia. This child, Horselover finds, is the one who communicated with him through the pink light. This child can communicate with Horselover in the current moment as well, and eventually leads him and his buddies out of the influence of the movie makers. Sophia's final message to Horselover Fat is to find faith in humans, not an ethereal pink light or a god.</p>
    <p>I felt it to be very meta and self-referential for Philip K Dick, who already loves that sort of thing. The split personalities of Horselover Fat and Philip K Dick himself, and interspersal of journal entries called an "Exegesis" intrigued me, but moreso confused me. At the end of the novel, Philip K. Dick resumes control of his personality split and calls the whole thing a schizophrenic episode, due to a drug he is consuming (and some other traumatic shit). I would not recommend this to others unless they were a PKD sicko.</p>

<h3 id="purity">The Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing by Soren Kierkegaard</h3>
<img src="images/kierkegaard-purity-of-heart.jpg" alt="cover of The Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing by Soren Kierkegaard" />
<p>A reread of the man who, along with Albert Camus, exploded my interest in existential philosophy. It is hard to briefly summarize such a dense text, but Kierkegaard does make his philosophy in Purity of Heart quite digestible for the average reader. By setting his discussion in the "Office of the Confessional"--the spritiual discussion so often depicted as a wooden chamber where an individual discusses their inner turmoil with a priest on the other side of a mesh divider--he is able to give readers the simple context they need to not only understand his philosophy better, he also provides them with an easy launchpad to contextualize their turmoil alongside his philosophy.</p>
<p>If I had to summarize what the Danish pimp discusses throughout this book, it is to live life with the sole devotion of living it. This means not shying away from punishment, not doing certain tasks solely for the reward, not allowing the busy-ness of life keep you from living life to the fullest--all sorts of things that either hinder us from living our life with complete faithful devotion or seem like part of devotion but truly are not. It's about having faith in yourself; that you can make the most of the journey--bumps and all--by believing that how you are living is the best you can do and always striving to make that "best" even better.</p>
<blockquote><p>All has its time, there is 'a time to be born and a time to die'; there is a time to jest lightheartedly in the spring breeze, and a time to break under the autumn storm; there is a time to burst forth into blossom, beside the running water, beloved by the stream, and a time to wither and be forgotten; a time to be sought out for one's beauty and a time to be unnoticed in one's wretchedness; there is a time to be nursed with care, and a time to be cast out with contempt; there is a time to delight in the warmth of the morning sun and a time to perish in the night's cold.</p><footer>--Soren Kierkegaard, The Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing</footer></blockquote>

<p>Hilarious satire. the entire cast was cracking me up. spending time in canada recently perhaps made me appreciate it further, but I would have been giggling no matter what.</p><p>Michael Moore going nutty with the bombing of a hospital is actually a nuclear arms facility joke. RIP John Candy.</p>
<p>Some favorite scenes: 
    <ul><li>Early hallway scene where they talk about all the disgraceful things Canadian culture has made popular like Neil Young and socialized medicine.</li>
    <li>St. Louis football Cardinals joke</li>
    <li>Capital of Canada is Ottawa joke (actually hilarious that it isn't Toronto)</li></ul>
