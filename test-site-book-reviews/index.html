    <ul><li>Main character: Eric Packer</li>
    <li>Setting: futuristic New York City</li>
    <li>Brief synopsis: rich venture capitalist Eric Packer takes a drive through New York City for a haircut and discusses his thoughts on life along the way</li></ul>
    <p>This is my second book by DeLillo--the first being White Noise. Their stories are not very comparable outside of the main characters being under the threat of something. In Cosmopolis, we follow the uber-affluent Eric Packer as he decides one day to get a haircut. Usually, he would hire someone come to him, but today he wants the damp, smelly New York City air to caress his body and soul as he takes a drive to a barber.</p>
    <p>His journey involves mostly being stuck in traffic, but even traffic is still much different to the wealthy. He is able to call up various coworkers and specialists to his car, to guide him, to shoot the shit with him and, for one lucky call-up, check his prostate. When he is not conducting these silly appointments, he is either jumping out of the car to impulsively eat or question his new wife who seems just as aloof as he is albeit with her own flair. All the while, he expouses his feelings and philosophies about the world around him, and what it means to him. Most of his ramblings do not make sense, or feel a bit hollow coming from such a spoiled brat, but they are intersting--they make you think. I could not tell you a lick of what he said, but the way he presents it is not boring to the reader and could elicit some cynicism about our fellow man if read into deep enough.</p>
    <p>Overall, the book isn't something I would recommend, but it was short and interesting enough for me to wonder about it to this day.</p>

    <ul><li>Main players: Ernest Burkhart, William Hale, Mollie Burkhart (and the Osage community, by extenstion), Federal agent Tom White</li>
    <li>Setting: Osage County, Oklahoma</li>
    <li>Brief synopsis: increasing numbers of Osage Indians are being murdered under suspicious conditions--how and why? Eventually, the FBI sends in Tom White to check it out.</li></ul>
    <p>I wanted to read this before I saw the movie, and after seeing the movie I wanted to read it even more. I finally got around to it and was equal parts capitvated and harrowed by the story.</p>
    <p>The book does a fantastic job giving history on the Osage people and land before diving into the nefarious forces looking to strip the Osage of their land (and their wealth from the oil on said land). Even though I had seen the movie, I could not believe the lengths the white people in the area went to to earn the rights to the Osage land. Clever accounting to keep some of the spoils is only the tip of the iceberg. As the book details, there were years-long plots against some of the Osage to gain the rights to their money involving love, deception and straight up murder.</p>
    <p>In the second half, the book details the regional and federal investigations into the allegations made by the Osage population. Most of the time, these allegations fell flat, but how and why? It takes the FBI (and a very special agent, Tom White) to eventually uncover the truly evil plots carried out by people like William Hale, Ernest Burkhart and their cronies--and they're just the ones who got caught.</p>
    <p>The book makes you wonder: how could someone do this to another human being? It really tests your faith in humanity. In the wrong mindset, it could be extremely depressing and make you feel helpless. In other mindsets: compassion. Compassion that you, as the reader and learner of these facts, would never ever be embroiled in something like this and compassion that you would stand up against it should you notice anything similar.</p>
