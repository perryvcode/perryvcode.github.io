    <ul><li>Main character: Eric Packer</li>
    <li>Setting: futuristic New York City</li>
    <li>Brief synopsis: rich venture capitalist Eric Packer takes a drive through New York City for a haircut and discusses his thoughts on life along the way</li></ul>
    <p>This is my second book by DeLillo--the first being White Noise. Their stories are not very comparable outside of the main characters being under the threat of something. In Cosmopolis, we follow the uber-affluent Eric Packer as he decides one day to get a haircut. Usually, he would hire someone come to him, but today he wants the damp, smelly New York City air to caress his body and soul as he takes a drive to a barber.</p>
    <p>His journey involves mostly being stuck in traffic, but even traffic is still much different to the wealthy. He is able to call up various coworkers and specialists to his car, to guide him, to shoot the shit with him and, for one lucky call-up, check his prostate. When he is not conducting these silly appointments, he is either jumping out of the car to impulsively eat or question his new wife who seems just as aloof as he is albeit with her own flair. All the while, he expouses his feelings and philosophies about the world around him, and what it means to him. Most of his ramblings do not make sense, or feel a bit hollow coming from such a spoiled brat, but they are intersting--they make you think. I could not tell you a lick of what he said, but the way he presents it is not boring to the reader and could elicit some cynicism about our fellow man if read into deep enough.</p>
    <p>Overall, the book isn't something I would recommend, but it was short and interesting enough for me to wonder about it to this day.</p>
